<h2>Welcome To Flock Ewe!</h2>

<p>First off... Yay!!! We’re so happy to have
Ewe as part of this magical experience! With the debut of the Big ASS Amazingly
Awesome Homosexual Sheep, we are looking forward to a transformative,
exhilarating and ever-evolving week. To set some context for making this the
best burn ever, we wanted to share some important things about the camp.</p>

<p>So we know this is a long ass document but
there are so many important and exciting things to share. Please take the time
to review everything once but just to help our skimmers, here is an outline.</p>

<h3><a name="WeWantEWE">We Want Ewe!!!</a></h3>

<p>You’re part of Flock Ewe because you’ve
worked hard. You’ve helped take BAAAHS from a leaping lamb of an idea to a big
ol’ low hanging disco balled BAAAHD ass. You are the people who are creating
the BAAAHS community, and we do mean COMMUNITY.</p>

<p>As you arrive, even before you put up your
tent, please introduce yourself to other flock members. There will be more than
60 of us in our camp, so we need to make ourselves known to one another. It’s
really simple: make friends and make more than friends, because, for this week
and beyond we are each other’s chosen BAAAHS family. Be awesome to each other.
So let’s make whoopee, show each other our favorite body part, make memories,
jump in and help however we can, you aren’t sure, ask.</p>

<p>We are a part of each other’s burn. And this
burn like the burn before, and the burn before that will be the best burn ever.
How do we know? Because we are all together with open hearts, open minds, open
arms, and very cuddly sensibilities that we will share with everyone who
crosses our path.</p>

<p>We know some of you are coming in groups
(little groups, big groups, couples, entourages). The beauty of smaller groups
comes when we can start morphing all strengths that come with established
relationships into a larger group dynamic. We can get a lot more accomplished
as a large cohesive collaborative entity than we can as individuals.
If you see a lamb that looks lost, bring them into the fold.</p>

<p>Keeping a collaborative flow all week will
start by looking outward, and asking (out loud even) how can we help each
other, how can we help those safely bareback our sheep, and most of all how we
can all help the BAAAHS project reach new levels of inclusion, interactivity and
awareness through our combined efforts and energy by sharing as we go, how to
continually improve something that none of us have done before.</p>

<p>We will do our best to schedule your volunteer
shifts together but take the rest of your time to really get to know the rest
of the flock, keeping in mind everyone that isn’t a part of larger group. There
are so many friends we haven’t met yet. We are all part of thriving, thrusting,
vibrant, first-of-its-kind community.</p>

<p>As the largest queer mutant vehicle ever brought
to Burning Man, this is a FIRST! And we are all a part of it!!!</p>

<h2><a name="CampBasics">Camp Basics</a></h2>

<p><b>Our Address:</b>7:30 and J (as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frum">John Frum</a>)</p>

<p>First and foremost, Flock Ewe believes in the
Golden Rule of Radical Self-Reliance. You must supply everything you need to
keep yourself alive.  This includes
taking care of yourself and taking care of those in your group.</p>

<p>We will be providing some basic infrastructure,
amenities, a cool ass place to be, but most of our focus is on getting this BIG
ASS AMAZING AWESOME HOMOSEXUAL SHEEP (you may have heard something about that)
out on the playa.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://survival.burningman.com">Burning Man Survival Guide</a> if
you have any questions on what that means.</p>

<h2><a name="CampRules">Camp Rules</a></h2>

<p><b>BE AMAZINGLY AWESOME.</b> This is a BE AWESOME economy. Give some of
your awesomeness to every person you encounter; you’ll get awesomeness back in
return. We promise.</p>

<p><b>When in doubt, the answer is "yes"!</b></p>

<p><b>Keep
the pigs at bay.</b> Unless it’s role-play, getting
arrested isn’t hot. Never bring law enforcement back to camp. The best way to
do this is to avoid them altogether and don’t get in trouble. Be discreet in
camp and out on the Playa.</p>

<p>How to Speak to Law Enforcement and other
great tips can be found <a href="http://www.lawyersforburners.com/home">here</a>
  (<a href="http://www.lawyersforburners.com/home">http://www.lawyersforburners.com/home</a>).</p>

<p>If for some reason you encounter law
enforcement, here a way to diffuse the situation:</p>

<ul style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em; margin: 1em;">
  <li>Officer, my name is [give your real name].</li>
  <li>Please explain to me your probable cause for stopping me, and if it seems reasonable to me, I will give you my personal identification information.</li>
  <li>I politely refuse to give you any further information.</li>
  <li>I do not consent to any search of me or my belongings, tent, vehicle or camp.</li>
  <li>Am I free to go?</li>
  <li>Remember, this is legal
  information not legal advice, which is an interpretation of the applicable
  law to specific circumstances. We urge you to consult a lawyer for legal
  advice about a particular legal question or issue you may have.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>No smoking on the BAAAHS or in common camp areas</b>.
This is both for safety and courtesy. We don’t want to have a big ass amazingly
awesome singed metal hulk... we’d have to change our acronym. Please limit
cigarette smoking in camp to your personal areas, and let your visitors know
we’d like to keep shared camp areas smoke-free.</p>

<p><b>No smoking illegal substances in public areas.</b>
That means pot. Top of the list. Even if you have a medical marijuana license.
In Nevada, it’s still illegal. The quickest way to get a member of one of the
multiple law enforcement agencies visiting you is a whiff of telltale Mary
Jane.</p>

<p>Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) have a pretty
loose definition of public areas: under a shade structure, inside your tent
with the door open, behind your car. All public areas are the same as the open
playa in their eyes. We don’t want to tell you what to do, but we do want to
help you not get a citation. There are lots of things you can do that don’t
involve smoking pot.  If you do smoke pot,
be discreet and be smart. Oh, and remember that part about not smoking on the
BAAAHS? Ditto.</p>

<p><b>Law
Enforcement and Illicit Substances.</b> So I’m not
saying that you are going to do illicit substances while you are at Burning
Man, but if you happen to be contemplating some such activity …</p>

<p>Here are some simple tips:</p>

<ul style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em; margin: 1em;">
<li><b>In-the-open is bad.</b> Don’t do anything in wide-open
areas. Particularly at night-time. You may not see anyone but night vision
goggles can clearly see you doing what you shouldn’t be doing. Remember LEOs
have a loose definition of public areas.</li>

<li><b>Private is good.</b> Go into a
porta pottie. Go into a protected spot. Mummify yourself in your sleeping bag</li>

<li><b>Never on the bus.</b> Very,
very, very bad idea. Do not do it on the bus when it’s moving, when it’s still,
when it’s in camp. Pearl does not do drugs. They upset her constitution.</li>

<li><b>Dark is better.</b> If you do
something in your tent, please, please, don’t do a Bunraku puppet show in there
for all the world to see. Turn out your lights. You may think you are discreet
but the shadows are giving us a blow by blow (so to speak).</li>

<li><b>No whippets.</b> DUH! Cops know what these are
and look for them lying around camps and then go and search your shit. Keep it
in your tent, Mary.</li>

<li><b>Gifting/Selling.</b> Um? Okay,
it’s always nice to give gifts. But LEOs have this very backwards view of it
called trafficking, distribution and sale. If it isn’t a good friend, don’t do
it.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the day, remember the mantra,
be discreet and be smart. I have seen too many people make a little slip and
have it ruin the rest of their Burn. Or other people’s burn. Not very nice.
‘Nuff said.</p>

<h2><a name="WhatWillWeProvide">What Will We Provide?</a></h2>

<p><b>Fun.</b> Absolutely. 100% Guaranteed. If you don’t have a good time, I
will personally call Cher and ask her to turn back time.</p>

<p><b>Awesomeness.</b> This is one of our calls to action. It’s not the big ass
amazingly OK sheep…it’s the BIG ASS AMAZINGLY Awesome Sheep…so be extra kind to
everyone we interact with, even the really annoying drunk ones, especially if
they are in our camp</p>

<p><b>Opportunity to Share.</b> While we are radically self reliant that
doesn’t mean you can’t bring delicious treats or surprises to share with us.
Signature drinks, dishes, moves, and looks can be shared as often and regularly
as you have the ability to. I, for one, would like an ice cream cake still
frozen, served Thursday at 4.</p>

<p><b>Fabulacious Camp Members.</b> Flock Ewe has been unanimously
voted (by itself) as THE place to be flocked in 2013. If you are feeling extra
sexy do it where someone can see it…</p>

<p><b>Communal Space.</b> Speaking of doing it where we can see it,
we’ll provide some great central social and lounging spaces. Comfy couches,
good conversation, puppy piles.</p>

<p><b>Luxurious
Open Air Showers.</b> Come See The Best Show in Town!
Now with Two Exciting Showers! Count them. Two!!! A pump shower and a second
shower for all you sun shower bag owners. 
We will be handling grey water removal. All you have to do is bring your
dirty ass self (and soap).</p>

<p><b>Water.</b> We will be providing water. The very essence of life itself. We
will be planning for about 2 gallons of water per person per day. HOWEVER, we
still recommend that you bring some water. Things happen. Water gets
contaminated. We should be fine BUT if you have some in reserve that will help
you or other folks. With that in mind, please bring 1 gallon of water per
person per day. To best make use of the camp water supply, please consider
bringing larger refillable water containers for your group. Fewer trips to the
main tank will help with sanity and convenience. <a
href="http://www.thereadystore.com/5-gallon-stackable-water-container">5 gallon refillable water cubes</a> are a great idea.</p>

<p><b>Gray water.</b> We are still working on the specifics of gray
water removal. We hope to have information to share at our All Flock Meeting.</p>

<p><b>Assorted other niceties.</b> Bike Racks, Shade structures,
maybe a Yurt.</p>

<p><b>Campy Programming.</b> For your shear delight, we are planning
some sashay and shantalicious programming throughout the week. We’ll tell you
more about this at the All Flock call (another compelling reason to dial in!)</p>

<p><b>Indie meals.</b> You are up to your own devices in providing
your food. It’s a great week for a diet. We are planning no camp meals. There
will be no communal kitchen either. It’s likely some groups will create their
own kitchen space so it’s possible if you are very, very nice, they may share
with you. Be respectful of their space and don’t presume. If you are naughty,
well, consequences will ensue.</p>

<p>For ideas on what to bring and preparing
meals on the playa – One of our fellow Flock members is working on some tips
that we’ll be sharing shortly.</p>

<p><b>Fucking/Non-Fucking.</b> Due to a lack of interest there will be no non-fucking section this
year.</p>

<h2><a name="SuggestedDonation">Suggested Donation</a></h2>

<p>We are asking for a suggested donation of
$100 to help cover camp costs including the rental of the trucks to bring
everything to the playa, fuel for our sexy beast of an art car, water (and grey
water removal), volunteer treats, shade structures and some surprises along the
way. We know some folks can’t afford to contribute money, don’t worry. In the
spirit of Burning Man, gifting is a more than suitable form of currency. If you
want to contribute more, well, who are we to say no to such largesse?</p>

<p>You can send your donation through the donate
link on the home page of the <a href="http://www.baaahs.org">BAAAHS website</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="WhenYouArrive">When You Arrive</a></h2>

<p>We will be putting together a camp map. For
the most part, this will indicate where larger vehicles, communal space and
larger camp clusters will be located. When you arrive, please try to find a
Shepherd who can help you get situated. If
you are coming in an RV, have a large vehicle or have specific camp needs, we
will work with you prior to departure so you have a good sense of where and how
to set yourself up.</p>

<h2><a name="WhatCanYouProvide">What Can You Provide?</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Your beautiful selves</li>
  <li>An open heart and mind</li>
  <li>A spirit of adventure and your awakened inner child</li>
  <li>The patience of a saint</li>
  <li>Everything you need to keep alive</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond that, we would love you to get
creative. Whatever you would like to do for the larger Flock Ewe community,
have at it.</p>

<p><b>Decorating The Camp.</b> Want to take our sallow cow patch and turn
it into a surreal meadow of Sheep Chic madness? Go right ahead. If you want to
get together with other flock members, please, please, go ahead and surprise us
(as long as things do not explode).  If
everyone brought a big green tarp, we could turn our homestead into a flat
green (though dusty) meadow. (Green tarps are very cheap here: <a
href="http://www.tarpsplus.com/">http://www.tarpsplus.com/</a> )</p>

<p><b>Meals, Cocktails.</b> Want to plan a meal for the camp, or a
cocktail party, a mid-morning refresh or afternoon high tea? That sounds like a
lovely way to give back to the flock. Even an ice-cold grape or a Popsicle,
food brings us closer together (especially if someone else is feeding you).</p>

<p>Be creative. Be thoughtful. Be inventive. Get
together with other flock members and have fun.</p>

<h2><a name="Shifts">Shifts</a></h2>

<p>We have a pant-peeingly hold-your-breath
lineup of events for the week. We’ll be sharing that in a separate document.
I’m also hard at work on our shift schedule. Thank you all your willingness to
pitch in during the week. It’s going to be an incredible, though evolutionary
process so please have patience. I’ll have more details in shortly.</p>

<h2><a name="Virgins">First Timers – Virgins</a></h2>

<p>We love you. We wish we could be you again.
Keep in mind Burning Man can be a wild ride. It’s misery and ecstasy. Have no
expectations. The environment can be harsh (be very, very kind to your feet!).
You can become easily over-stimulated (no comment). Just take it in and let it
take you in. Don’t compare and contrast. At its core Burning Man will be your
personal experience as part of the larger community. Take care of yourself.</p>

<p><b>Be Kind.</b> Be kind to your friends and your loved
ones. If you are bringing first timers, please watch out for them. And above
all, drink water. If you are thirsty, you’re probably dehydrated. Piss Clear.</p>

<p><b>No MOOP.</b> Old timers know this. Everything that
comes to Burning Man must leave too. That means 100% of garbage. MOOP: Matter
Out Of Place. We ask that throughout the week you make an effort to keep our
camp clean. And when you pack up, you make sure your space is spotless. And I
do mean spotless. Nothing on the ground that didn’t come there naturally. Not a
nail (finger or otherwise), a sequin, a thread. Nothing. For more on what
constitutes MOOP, <a
href="http://www.burningman.com/environment/playa_restoration/">please check this out.</a> </p>

<h2><a name="FinalThoughts">Final Thoughts</a></h2>

<p>Please bear in mind, that over the week,
things will evolve, patience will be strained, brain cells dissolved. Nothing
is set in stone. We ask for you to be equally as pliable (insert innuendo
here).  Together, we are going on a
wonderful, playful, serious, “you’ll shoot your eye out” learning experience.
If you have ideas on how to improve things, we welcome that feedback (but don’t
take it personally if we listen and then do the opposite). At the end of the
day, it’s about us forming a community and giving a big ass amazingly awesome
gift back to the greater playa world. 
Everything else is small in comparison. Please bring your stiff upper
lip and your big girl panties. This is Burning Man. This is BAAAHS. Thank you
and good night.</p>
