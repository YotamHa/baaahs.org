        </ul>

        <h4>Setting up for setup:</h4>

        <p><b>Crew tables:</b> each of the crews (Party, Business, and Head & Hind) need a folding table near their
          workspace.</p>

        <p>Tape the following sheets to each table:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sign-in sheet</li>
          <li>Shift signup list</li>
          <li>Assembly instructions (that crew's section)</li>
          <li>Bolt sizing chart</li>
          <li>Panel map (that crew's)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Place these items on or under each table:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gloves</li>
          <li>Panel hanging totes (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>" hardware, vice grips, aligner pins</li>
          <li>Hand tools (socket wrenches, pliers, …)</li>
          <li>Other hardware</li>
          <li>Hardhats</li>
          <li>Head lamps (if night)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Craft services:</b> space for food, snacks, and drinks.</p>

        <p><b>Safety:</b> ensure that a well-stocked first aid kit and a fire extinguisher is on site their locations
          are well-known.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Crew Lead</h3>

        <p>There is a crew lead for each of the crews (Party, Business, and Head & Hind). Each crew lead is
          responsible for instructing (often inexperienced) crew members in safely assembling
          their part of the sheep. They should:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Read and understand the setup instructions ahead of time.</li>
          <li>Be aware of the setup schedule.</li>
          <li>Give crew members an overview of what they'll be working on, and communicate goals for the shift.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate procedures (e.g. panel hanging).</li>
          <li>Educate crew members on setup basics — sizes of hardware, names of tools, etc.</li>
          <li>If issues arise, help debug them and pull in the setup lead.</li>
          <li>Watch for any safety issues.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Fluffer</h3>

        <p>Each crew should have a fluffer. The fluffer picks up stuff their crew drops, grabs stuff on request,
          makes sure they're hydrated and taking enough breaks, etc.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Noms</h3>

        <p>Noms manages the craft services table. Keep cold drinks (water, soft drinks) and light snacks available
          throughout setup. Coffee and pastries in the AM. For shifts that overlap normal meal times, and for shifts
          of four hours or more, provide something more substantial like pizza or a sandwich platter.</p>

      <h2>Party Crew Setup(Driver) Side Setup</h2>

      <p>The Party Crew works mostly on the "party side", a.k.a. the driver side, of the sheep.</p>

      <p>Overview:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Install speaker shelves.</li>
        <li>Install DJ platform.</li>
        <li>Install mounting struts.</li>
        <li>Install initial mount panels.</li>
        <li>Install remainder of panels.</li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>

      <p><b>Install speaker shelves.</b> For stationary setup, only one bolt (2&quot;×½&quot;) is needed in each slot.
        First, slide center shelf into holes on side of bus. You’ll need to wiggle it to get it in. It should end up
        flush
        with the side of the bus. Next, install the right shelf and bolt to center shelf. Last, install the left shelf.
        For
        stationary setup, the shelves are only secure enough for the speakers OR for a single person at a time.
      </p>

            bolt
            in place (finger-tight) to the dropped beam that’s inset two feet from the edge of the bus (2 bolts).
          </li>
          <li>Slide the aft platform in place. To align it properly, pull it away from the bus ½”, drop in place, and
            slide
            back toward the bus. Align the holes and bolt to the dropped beam (2 bolts).
          </li>
          <li>For mobile, add 5 additional bolts along the edge of the bus.</li>
          <li>Tighten all the bolts with wrenches.</li>

      <p><i>Illustration of panel labels</i></p>

      <p>The rest of the panels go up and come down in groups as indicated below. For stationary setup, use heavy-duty
        zip
        ties wherever possible. In some cases zip ties may not be strong enough and ¼&quot; hardware (bolt, two washers,
        and
        a wingnut) will be necessary.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Raise the panel or group of panels into place.</li>
        <li>Align edges of panel and use tapered steel pin to line up holes. Pick a hole as near to the end as possible
          while still allowing hardware to be inserted. Try to reuse holes from previous installations if possible.
        </li>
        <li>Use a vice grip to clamp the panel to its neighbor.</li>

      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>Install panels 7, 17, and 21.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Panel 7 sits on strut 7ABC. Use a short ⅜&quot; bolt, finger-tight.</li>
        <li>Panel 17 sits on struts 17ABC and 17DEF. Use short ⅜&quot; bolts, finger-tight.</li>
        <li>Panel 21 connects to a punched angle iron bracket on the side stair’s upper platform. Use a short ⅜&quot;
          bolt,
          finger-tight. The other end attaches to panel 17. Use ¼&quot; hardware, finger-tight.
        </li>
        <li>Panel 41 sits on strut 41ABC. Use a short ⅜&quot; bolt, finger-tight.</li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>

      <p>The rest of the panels go up and come down in groups as indicated below. For stationary setup, use heavy-duty
        zip
        ties wherever possible. In some cases zip ties may not be strong enough and ¼&quot; hardware (bolt, two washers,
        and
        a wingnut) will be necessary.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Raise the panel or group of panels into place.</li>
        <li>Align edges of panel and use tapered steel pin to line up holes. Pick a hole as near to the end as possible
          while still allowing hardware to be inserted. Try to reuse holes from previous installations if possible.
        </li>
        <li>Use a vice grip to clamp the panel to its neighbor.</li>
        <li>Remove the steel pin and replace with a heavy-duty zip tie or ¼&quot; hardware.</li>
        <li>Remove vice grip.</li>
        <li>Repeat for the other end of the edge.</li>
        <li>Repeat for other vertices on the panel or panel group.</li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>

      <p>Two teams may install the front and rear panels simultaneously.</p>

        <li>Hock-ish? 40/41/42 (panel 41 sits on strut 41ABC at the labeled spot. Use a short ⅜&quot; bolt,
          finger-tight.)
        </li>
        <li>Leg (33/36/34/37/43 — be ready to attach strut 33)</li>
        <li>Dock-ish? 39/32/35/RP2</li>
        <li>24 (and maybe 25?)</li>
        <li>Back (19)</li>
        <li>Hind Hoof (38 — inset a bit behind the other panels, attach with zip ties)
        </li>

      <h2>Head Assembly</h2>

      <p><b></b></p>

      <p><b>Install face mounting bracket.</b> Mounts on Arch #1 from top platform. Hardware: four 3&quot;×¼&quot; bolts
        through top, two 3&quot;×¼&quot; bolts through bottom.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p><b>Install face.</b> Need: 10’ rope, L and R face support struts; small aligner pin; two 2&quot;×¼&quot; bolts;
        four wood screws and drill.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Set face on the top platform facing forward, and tilted back so he’s looking upward. Attach L and R face
          support
          struts to the 5-hole punched angle iron bracket on the brow (use the outer holes, attach with ¼&quot;
          hardware).
          Tie rope to brow between struts.
        </li>
        <li>With the face still tilted back so he’s looking forward and upward, slide the face along the platform, then
          along the face mounting bracket until the back edge of his chin rests at the edge of the mounting bracket.
          There
          are safety stops to prevent the face from sliding off the edge.
        </li>
        <li>Holding onto the L and R face support struts and the rope, tilt the face forward until he’s looking straight
          ahead. Secure the face (at the back of his chin) to the mounting bracket using two ¼&quot; bolts.
        </li>
        <li>Secure the L and R face support struts to the platform where indicated using two wood screws for each strut.
          Tie
          the rope to any secure spot on the platform.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>

      <p><b>Install ears.</b></p>

      <p>Need: L and R aluminum head support studs; L and R ears; F16D/F20D/F17D and F16P/F20P/F17P panels
        (preassembled);
        aligner pin; impact driver with 9/16&quot; deep socket; pliers; nine 1.5&quot;×⅜&quot; bolts; 1’ length of rope;
        four 4&quot;×⅜&quot; bolts; two 10’ lengths of rope.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>Repeat for D(L) and P(R) sides:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>On the top platform, attach the F16/F20/F17 panel assembly to the aluminum head support stud using three 1½&quot;×⅜&quot;
          bolts. Attachment points are marked on the stud and on the panels.
        </li>
        <li>Slide the punched angle iron protruding from the ear through the forward hole in the F16/F20/F17 panel
          assembly
          and bolt it to the stud.
        </li>
        <li>Attach the back of the ear to the panel (using a ¼&quot; bolt on the P side and a short rope on the D side).
        </li>
        <li>Mount the aluminum head support stud (with panels and ear already attached) to Arch #1 using two 4&quot;×⅜&quot;
          bolts. The stud sits on the outside of the 2&quot;×2&quot; arch column, resting on the lower 1&quot;×1½&quot;
          part
          of the column.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>
